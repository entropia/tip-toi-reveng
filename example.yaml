# This is an example source file for a TipToi file
# The basic format is YAML

# You can compile this running
# ./tttool assemble example.yaml example.gme

# The product ID must match that of the book you want to use this with
product-id: 42

# The media path is optional
# The default is "%s", i.e. to look in the current directory
# If you use "example/Buch1_%s", here then P(test) will use
# the file "example/Buch1_test.ogg".
# Ogg files should be Mono, 22050 Hz.
# tttool will append .wav or .ogg and uses whatever it finds
media-path: example/%s

# The comment does not really matter

# Register initalisation. This is simply list of set-commands.
# Every register not set is initialized to 0

# The sounds to play on start-up
welcome: bing, hello

# This is the interesting part: Scripts.
# Technically, this is an assoiative list with the OID as an index,
# and a list of strings as the content
scripts:
  # We begin to specify what to do when the area in the book with the OID code
  # 8066 is touched.
  8066:
  # The following line means: If register $mode is set to 1, then set it to 2, and
  # increment register $1 by one, and play the sound example/hello.ogg.
  - $mode==1? $mode:=2 $1+=1 P(hello)
  # Here, the pen is going to play one of these three sounds randomly.
  - $mode==2? $mode+=1 P(one,two,three)
  - $mode==3? $mode:=1 P(back)
  # You can either refer to a concrete register ($1), or a named register.
  # tttool will map these to otherwise unused registers.
  8067:
  - $1==0?
  - $1==1? P(one)
  - $1==2? P(two)
  - $1==3? P(three)
  # Besides == and !=, there are also the comparisons < and >=
  - $1!=1? $1 != 2? $1 != 3? $1:=0 P(back)
