Usage: tttool oid-codes YAML
  creates files for every OID in the yaml file (default: PNG).

Available options:
  YAML                     Yaml file to read
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Uses oid-<code>.<format> as the file name.

Use the global options to configure size, file format

resolution and blackness of the code (see ./tttool --help).

Note that it used to work to call "tttool oid-code foo.yaml". Please use "tttool
oid-codes" for that now.
