If the language of a GME file is not empty and does not match the pen's
language, the pen will refuse to play it. So for example you cannot play a
French GME file using a pen set to German. This command allows you to adjust a
GME file's language to match the pen's language, so you can play the GME file.

WARNING: This modifies the given GME file in place.
