Usage: tttool set-language (--empty | LANG) GME
  sets the language field of an GME file

Available options:
  LANG                     Language (e.g. GERMAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, DUTCH…)
  GME                      GME file to modify
  -h,--help                Show this help text

If the language of a GME file is not empty and does not match the pen's
language, the pen will refuse to play it. So for example you cannot play a
French GME file using a pen set to German. This command allows you to adjust a
GME file's language, and either remove it completely (with --empty) or to match
the pen's language, so you can play the GME file.

WARNING: This modifies the given GME file in place.
