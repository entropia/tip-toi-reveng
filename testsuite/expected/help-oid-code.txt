Usage: tttool oid-code [--raw] RANGE
  creates PNG files for each given code(s)

Available options:
  --raw                    take the given codes as "raw codes" (rarely needed)
  RANGE                    OID range, for example e.g. 1,3,1000-1085.
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Uses oid-<code>.png as the file name.

Use the global options to configure size, resolution and blackness of the code
(see ./tttool --help).

Note that it used to work to call "tttool oid-code foo.yaml". Please use "tttool
oid-codes" for that now.
